# Community Connect Platform

## Modern Property Management. Made Simple.

 * Overview
- Community Connect is a bespoke, multi-tenant Property Management System (PMS) designed to digitize and automate the operations of residential real estate management. Built to solve the challenges of manual invoicing, delayed communication, and operational inefficiency, the platform serves as a centralized hub for four distinct stakeholders: Property Managers, Home Owners, Tenants, and Security Personnel.

- This project was developed as a comprehensive solution for managing multiple properties, automating financial workflows, and ensuring real-time resident services.

##  Key Features
###  For Property Managers (Admin & Operations)

- Unified Dashboard: A bird's-eye view of all managed properties with real-time Occupancy Metrics.
- Multi-Tenancy: Scalable architecture allowing different organizations to manage their portfolios in isolation.
- Bulk Unit Creator: A powerful tool to generate hundreds of units (e.g., "Units 101-200") in seconds.
- Financial Oversight: Track paid vs. unpaid invoices across all buildings instantly.
- Digital Notice Board: Post official announcements visible only to residents of specific properties.

##  For Home Owners (Landlords)

- Financial Hub: A dedicated portal to view all service charge invoices, payment history, and due dates.
- Asset Management: View owned units and manage parking lot assignments.
- Tenant Invoicing: Ability to generate and send rent invoices directly to their current tenants.

## For Tenants (Residents)

- Instant Alerts: Real-time notifications for visitors and package deliveries via a polling system linked to the Security Desk.
- Maintenance Ticketing: Submit repair requests (e.g., "Leaking pipe") and track their status from 'Open' to 'Resolved'.
- M-Pesa Integration (Simulated): "Pay Now" functionality for rent and service charge invoices.

## For Security Desk

- Rapid Alert System: A simplified, focused interface for logging visitor arrivals and deliveries, triggering instant alerts on tenant dashboards.

## Technology Stack

- Frontend: Bootstrap 5, HTML5, CSS3
- Interactivity: Vanilla JavaScript, Fetch API (AJAX)
- Database: SQLite (Development) / PostgreSQL (Production ready)
